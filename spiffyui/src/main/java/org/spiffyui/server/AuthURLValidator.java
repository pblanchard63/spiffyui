 * The server trusts the client to pass the URL for the authentication server.

 * URL to an untrusted authentication server and get the authentication proxy servlet
 * to forward the user's credentials there.

 * like JavaScript running in the browser.  This interface allows you to provide
 * a custom whitelist of trusted authentication servers

 * 
 * <p>
 * If you do not provide this interface the default behavior is to only allow requests
 * to an authentication server hosted on the same web server as the Spiffy UI framework.
